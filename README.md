HeartBeat
=========

A simple demonstration of client/server communication via Socket.IO.

Step-by-Step tutorials to reproduce this code are available at:

[Part 1](http://blog.kylelevin.com/listening-to-a-server-heartbeat-using-node-js-ios-and-socket-io-part-1/) and [Part 2](http://blog.kylelevin.com/listening-to-a-server-heartbeat-using-node-js-ios-and-socket-io-part-2/)

##Setup

This entire setup process is documented heavily in the blog posts linked to above.

To get started, open the Xcode Project in the iOS folder.  This is confirmed to work with `Xcode 5.1` and the `iOS 7.1 SDK`.

Assuming you have `Node.js` installed:

Open up `Terminal` and execute 

    cd </path/to/HeartBeat/server/heartbeat>.
    node server.js
